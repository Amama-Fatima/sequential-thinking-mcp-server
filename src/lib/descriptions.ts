const sequentialThinkingToolDescription = `
Adaptive multi-step reflective reasoning tool for complex problem-solving.

This tool enables dynamic thinking processes where you can:
- Break down complex problems into sequential steps
- Adjust the total number of thoughts as understanding deepens
- Revise previous thoughts when new insights emerge
- Branch into alternative reasoning paths
- Express uncertainty and explore different approaches
- Maintain context across multiple thinking steps

The tool supports non-linear progress and iterative refinement, allowing for a natural problem-solving flow that adapts as you work through challenges.`;
